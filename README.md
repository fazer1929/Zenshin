## Inspiration
We observed that many individual and small business (especially but not limited to creatives) were facing a lot of problems reaching their potential customers and  earning money.
Moreover it is also very difficult for a consumer to find services of daily needs with no prior contacts such as Painting, Plumbing, Sound Design, etc.
## What it does
It is a web app which connects service providers with their customers through an easy to use interface, which let's **service providers to grow their business and generate more revenue and the customers to find all kinds of services easily through a few clicks**.

## How we built it
We Built it Using ReactJs along with Material-UI and ContextAPI for our frontend and Firebase and Firestore for our backend.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was to decide the workflow so both the customers and the service providers can have ease of access to the platform
Few other challenges we ran into were implementing the Chat feature, which was difficult to integrate with the entire workflow, the Filters for finding service was also a little tedious. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It was overall a big project and we're really happy that we were able to make this much progress in just two days. We are also proud of the fact that we made something that can potentially turn into a real product and can help people in the community,

## What we learned
We learnt designing pages with Material-UI, implementing chats with Firestore and Firebase and methods to develop a MVP fast.

## What's next for Zenshin
As we mentioned, we are considering to turn it to a real product that can benefit the community, and for that we have a lot of optimizations and features to consider such as a more precise location based search, paging, additional security and many more.
